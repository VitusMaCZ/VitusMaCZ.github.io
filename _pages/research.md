  * **Topic 1: RDARS empowered wireless communication system**
     * To support the stringent performance requirements of future 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, we first proposed a novel architecture called "Reconfigurable Distributed Antennas and Reflecting Surface (RDARS)". Such a architecture embedded with the merits of both the distributed antenna system (DAS) and antenna selection technique with inherent macro-diversity and selection diversity, as well as the concept of ``reconfigurability" introduced by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to customize the wireless channel. To unveil the potential of such a architecture, we characterized the performance of the RDARS-aided wireless communication system with soild theoretical analysis, and then provided rigorous proof to demonstrate its superiority in terms of performance enhancement. We then built up a real RDARS-aided wireless communication demo for experiments using a fabricated RDARS's prototype. Experimental results validate the performance enhancement introduced by the RDARS.
